            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>WPdirectory mirrors the WordPress Plugin and Theme Directories, allowing lightning fast regex search. It does this by using trigram indexing, allowing it to only search relevant files. The projects aims to significantly reduce the time required for searching the Plugin and Theme Directories, saving time and encouraging more use.</p>
            <p>WPdir was inspired by the various Directory Slurper projects by <a href="https://github.com/markjaquith/WordPress-Plugin-Directory-Slurper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mark Jaquith</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ipstenu/WordPress-Theme-Directory-Slurper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ipstenu</a> and many others. It is built using Go on the backend and React on the frontend, it uses Google's <a href="https://github.com/google/codesearch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">codesearch</a> tool for indexing and search.</p>
